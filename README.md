### COMP4971C Independent Study Project: Using Generative Deep Learning Models to create NFT Artwork	

This is an Independent study project during Spring 2021/2022 semester, conducted under the directed guidance of Dr. David Rossiter from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The project focuses on synthizing digital artwork using machine learning generative models. A collection of 1000 are created based on a dataset of popular NFTs using the VQGAN+CLIP model pre-trained on the wikiart16384 dataset.

The best 100 artworks judging by some [objective characteristics of good art](https://bueskenart.com/characteristics-of-good-art/) will be soon listed for as NFTs on [my rarible profile](https://rarible.com/mohamed-sobhy)
